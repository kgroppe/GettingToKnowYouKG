<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Hi! My name is Katherine Groppe. I have seven siblings, along with two dogs and two fish.<br> I am from Illinois, having lived in Westchester for my entire life.

<h4>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h4>
<p>For me, my favorite hobby at the moment is knitting. I am currently working on a paneled blanket.<br> I find knitting very relaxing, and am quite pleased with the recent progress that
I have made on the blanket.<br> One reason that I think I find knitting relaxing is that it is a reptative activity, but still engaging as there are consequences if you make a mistake.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Fun Fact</h4>
<p>A fun fact about me is that I was on a First Tech Challenge Robotics Team during Highschool.<br> The team, STEMper Fi #10836, is still active, and is currently preparing for Regionals here in Illinois.</p>
